        Platinum elevates the traditional capital market infrastructure in
        purpose to benefit from the blockchain technology: gradual capital
        formation; immediate settlement of unique, non-subordinate assets;
        insignificant trade fees; and many others.

        To make this update possible, there is a need for a security token
        standard, which entail all blockchain advantages and still satisfy the
        regulations. Having this standard at hand, security token issuers,
        investors, exchanges, wallets, custody providers, and regulators are
        able to enjoy the benefits of the technology, interoperability becomes
        easier, and adoption can be widespread. Clearly, the ERC-20 standard
        made a revolution for utility tokens, so there is a need for a security
        token standard.

        PLATINUM SECURITY TOKEN STANDARD or PLS-360 is an extension of ERC-20
        that allows to limit transactions of blockchain tokens. ERC-20 tokens do
        not follow any transfer limitations and can be traded by anyone, which
        is fine for utility tokens. But when it comes to securities, all holders
        have to obtain KYC/AML verification and follow many other restrictions
        regarding distribution and trading of securities. PLS-360 is a great way
        to solve this issue. Platinum Security Token Standard is developed to
        ensure maintenance of regulatory compliance through transfer
        restrictions. Moreover, it is unanimous with the ERC-20, making it
        interoperable with most of the blockchain infrastructures which exist
        today.
