  "toMakeThisUpdatePossible": "To make this update possible, there is a need for a security token          standard, which entail all blockchain advantages and still satisfy the          regulations. Having this standard at hand, security token issuers,          investors, exchanges, wallets, custody providers, and regulators are          able to enjoy the benefits of the technology, interoperability becomes          easier, and adoption can be widespread. Clearly, the ERC-20 standard          made a revolution for utility tokens, so there is a need for a          security token standard.",
  "platinumSecurityTokenStandardOr": "PLATINUM SECURITY TOKEN STANDARD or PLS-360 is an extension of ERC-20          that allows to limit transactions of blockchain tokens. ERC-20 tokens          do not follow any transfer limitations and can be traded by anyone,          which is fine for utility tokens. But when it comes to securities, all          holders have to obtain KYC/AML verification and follow many other          restrictions regarding distribution and trading of securities. PLS-360          is a great way to solve this issue. Platinum Security Token Standard          is developed to ensure maintenance of regulatory compliance through          transfer restrictions. Moreover, it is unanimous with the ERC-20,          making it interoperable with most of the blockchain infrastructures          which exist today."
