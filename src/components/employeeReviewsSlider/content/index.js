It helps, at least me, to easily find a solution to any problem. Before I would have a panic attack, in turn now, I take three deep breaths and start looking for ways to overcome the issue. Normally it doesn't take me much time to solve the puzzle, but in some cases, I ask my fellow colleagues for help, and within minutes they haven't only helped me but also cheered me up for the rest of the day!`,

Moreover, my boss acknowledges that he can't know everything, that's why he values and respects the opinion based on my experience. That's very encouraging when no one tells you what to do, or not to do, of course, you should be always acting in good faith and do your job well.`,
